# PySky - the Python Weather Toolset

PySky is a python weather toolkit that provides access into a number of publicly available weather databases.  The goal of PySky is to provide a fast and easy-to-use interface to weather data in a pythonic way.  The current implementation focuses on United States weather data from NOAA, although future weather systems will be incorporated.  In particularly, it provides hourly and daily forecast summaries.
